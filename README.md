| $k$-nearest neighbors graph in Python | `scikit-learn` helps us to construct $k$-nn graphs. This notebook uses 2D data to construct and visualize $k$-nn graphs. | [code](https://github.com/mashaan14/python-tutorials/blob/main/knn_graph.ipynb) | [video](https://youtube.com/shorts/YHqA9DoQZio?feature=share) |
| Visualizing graphs in Python | This notebook shows how to visualize graphs in python using `NetworkX` and `Matplotlib` libraries. | [code](https://github.com/mashaan14/python-tutorials/blob/main/graphs_visualization.ipynb) | |
| Vectorization in $k$-means clustering | This example shows a vectorized way on how to compute the distance from points to the centroids in $k$-means clustering. | [code](https://github.com/mashaan14/python-tutorials/blob/main/Vectorization_01.ipynb) | |
| Label Propagation using vectorization | This example shows a simple problem of propagating labels from $k$-means centroids to the rest of the dataset. A label will be assigned simply based on the minimum distance. | [code](https://github.com/mashaan14/python-tutorials/blob/main/Vectorization_02.ipynb) | |
