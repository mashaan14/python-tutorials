# python-tutorials
A collection of notebooks on vectorization and graphs in python. You can open them directly in google colab.

## Vectorization-in-Python
Vectorization refers to the style of coding where operations are applied to the whole array instead of individual elements. You can read more about vectorization on this link __[this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming)__.

### Vectorization_01.ipynb
This example shows a vectorized way on how to compute the distance from points to the centroids in $k$-means clustering.

### Vectorization_02.ipynb
This example shows a simple problem of propagating labels from $k$-means centroids to the rest of the dataset. A label will be assigned simply based on the minimum distance.

## Graphs-in-Python

### graphs_visualization.ipynb
This notebook shows how to visualize graphs in python using `NetworkX` and `Matplotlib` libraries.

### knn_graph.ipynb
`scikit-learn` helps us to construct $k$-nn graphs. This notebook uses 2D data to construct and visualize $k$-nn graphs.
